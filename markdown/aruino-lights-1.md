#Arduino & Bluetooth Controlled LED Lights
##Part 1
####by Ben Nagy 29 May 2017

I had an idea a while back to make a Bluetooth controlled LED array for mood lighting in my living room. There are already a multitude of products available off-the-shelf like the Philips Hue and the MiLight but I wanted to roll my own, not just because it's more fun but because it turned out to be cheaper as well.

This is the first part of a 5-article series covering the design and development of a custom Bluetooth-controlled LED lighting system using Arduinos. Links to the other articles are available below:

1. Introduction & video
2. PCB development
3. Color theory
4. Code development
5. Bluetooth & microphone extension

Here is a video of the final product:
