  I had an idea a while back to make a Bluetooth controlled LED array for mood lighting in my living room. There are already a multitude of products available off-the-shelf like the Philips Hue and the MiLight but I wanted to roll my own, not just because
  it's more fun but because it turned out to be cheaper as well.
